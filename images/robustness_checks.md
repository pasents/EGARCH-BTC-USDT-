## 🛡️ Robustness & Validation Checks

| Check                                        | Result                      | Notes                                       |
|:---------------------------------------------|:----------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Transaction costs modeled                    | 5.0 bps per side            | Applied on entries and exits.               |
| Execution lag                                | Next-bar                    | Breach detected at t, enter at t+1 if flat. |
| Walk-forward re-fitting                      | EGARCH re-fit every 30 bars | Burn-in=400; Student-t innovations.         |
| Annualization inference                      | k=365                       | Detected from index frequency/fallback.     |
| Missing weeks (if weekly)                    | 0                           | Data integrity check on W-MON grid.         |
| Next-bar entry violations                    | 0                           | Any entry without prior-bar breach.         |
| Next-bar entry violations (flat at t-1 only) | 0                           | Stricter condition; should be ~0.           |
| Same-bar entry/exit trades                   | 0                           | Typically due to forced close.              |
| Forced closes at final bar                   | 1                           | Honest stats when position open at end.     |
| Effective sample size (returns)              | Strat=2278, B&H=2093        | Accounts for autocorrelation.               |
| Data frequency                               | Daily                       | Controlled via USE_WEEKLY.                  |
